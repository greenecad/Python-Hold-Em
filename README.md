YOu are such a good boy for going to the read me

Rules:
This will be a Texas Hold' Em variant of Poker but I really don't feel like learning the full rules, so there will be some differneces.

The Ante/ Blinds/ Buy-in, will be an agreed upon amount of money that the bots will either raise, call or fold, until all bots desiring to play call.
Please don't make the bot agressive in this part, set a limit of when to fold or stop raising por favor.

I am too lazy to code the dealer moving place, so order will always be the same until an elimination occurs
 noit done
